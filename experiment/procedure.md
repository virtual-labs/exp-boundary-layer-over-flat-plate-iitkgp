# Procedure

1. Fix the flat plate attachment and the boundary layer probe in the test section of the Airflow bench.

2. Ensure the boundary layer probe is placed in a proper orientation, with the pitot head facing the inlet of the test section.

3. Switch on the airflow and record the pressure at the inlet and the settling chamber to estimate the flow velocity.

4. Using the micrometer, slide the boundary layer probe away from the flat plate with increments of small distances.

5. Record pressure at each increment.

6. Repeat the experiment at different intervals in the streamwise direction.

7. Tabulate all the data and calculate The displacement and momentum thickness.
